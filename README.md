| [Contains Duplicate](https://github.com/rad16x/grinding-leetcode/blob/main/containsDuplicate.go) | Easy       | Array, Hash Table          | Used a hash table to check for duplicate values in the 'nums' array. Created a map, checkDup , to keep track of unique elements. Iterated through the array, and for each element, checked if it already exists in the checkDup map. If it did, returned true to indicate the presence of a duplicate; otherwise, marked the element as seen in the map. If no duplicates were found, returned false. |
| [Valid Anagram](https://github.com/rad16x/grinding-leetcode/blob/main/isAnagram.go)              | Easy       | String                     | Checked if the lengths of strings s and t are different; if so, returned false. Created character count arrays for both strings, where each index represents a letter's count. Compared the character count arrays and returned false if they didn't match, indicating that t is not an anagram of s. Returned true if the arrays matched.                                                            |
| [Two Sum](https://github.com/rad16x/grinding-leetcode/blob/main/twoSum.go)                       | Easy       | Array, Hash Table          | Created a map, indexMap, to store the indices of elements as they are iterated through the nums array. For each element, checked if the complement (i.e., target - num) exists in the map. If it did, returned the indices of the two numbers whose sum equals the target. Otherwise, stored the current element's index in the map. If no valid pair was found, returned an empty array.             |
| [Group Anagrams](https://github.com/rad16x/grinding-leetcode/blob/main/twoSum.go)                | Medium     | String, Hash Table         | Grouped anagrams from the strs array using a hash map. For each string, created a key represented as a [26]byte array, where each element counts the occurrence of a letter in the string. Added the string to the corresponding key in the map. Finally, collected the grouped anagrams from the map into a result array and returned it.                                                            |
| [Top K Frequent Elements](https://github.com/rad16x/grinding-leetcode/blob/main/topKFrequent.go) | Medium     | Array, Hash Table, Sorting | Identified the frequency of each element in the nums array using a hash map, countMap . Created a structure, Pair , to hold the value and frequency of each element. Constructed a slice, pairs , to store the pairs of values and frequencies from the map. Sorted the pairs in descending order of frequency. Extracted the top K frequent elements from the sorted pairs and returned them.        |
